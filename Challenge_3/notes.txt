Address Book 
Lowell Organization Logistics needs a convenient way to track delivery drivers' 
contact info that can be used in conjunction with some other software they already have. 
They need a repository to hold contact info, as well as a console application that can 
add, retrieve, modify, or remove information. In case they want to make changes or 
experience bugs, they also want some Unit Tests to make sure the repository is still functioning correctly.

ID (a unique integer, used as the dictionary key - there are many ways to ensure these are unique, pick any you like)

List all contacts (R)
